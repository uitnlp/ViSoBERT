# <a name="introduction"></a> ViSoBERT: A Pre-Trained Language Model for Vietnamese Social Media Text Processing (EMNLP'2023)

ViSoBERT is the state-of-the-art language model for Vietnamese social media tasks:

 - ViSoBERT is the first monolingual MLM (XLM-R architecture) built from scratch specifically for Vietnamese social media text.
 - ViSoBERT outperforms previous monolingual, multilingual, and multilingual social media approaches, obtaining new state-of-the-art performances on four downstream Vietnamese social media tasks.

The general architecture and experimental results of ViSoBERT can be found in our [paper](https://openreview.net/forum?id=gqkg54QNDY):
